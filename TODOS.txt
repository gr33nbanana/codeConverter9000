 1-- package all the functions from converter9000 in a module like "myUtils.py" to be able to import and use in all the other parsers as well.
 3-- Change the workflow of the scripts to be more function oriented for:
    DONE [-- Type declaration --]
    [arithmetic IF updating]
    [DO LOOP updates]

  like:
      ....
      utils
      ....
      if __name__ == __main__:
         bigFunction1()
         bigFunction2()
         etc ...

2-- Checkout an older commit of ATHLET_CD master to have old .f files to test every option from the docopt arguments
4-- Have a dummy .f fortran file to "experiment" on with the script or use as a showcase what the script does. (Free formatting, type declaration, changing DO loops and if statements)
5-- implement more specific try catch exceptions which raise errors or exceptions provided from Python
