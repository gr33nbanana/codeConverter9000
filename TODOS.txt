 1-- package all the functions from converter9000 in a module like "myUtils.py" to be able to import and use in all the other parsers as well.
 2-- Checkout an older commit of ATHLET_CD master to have old .f files to test every option from the docopt arguments
 3-- For Type declaration, arithmetic IF updating and DO LOOP updates change the workflow of the scripts to be:
      ....
      utils
      ....
      if __name__ == __main__:
         bigFunction1()
         bigFunction2()
         etc ...

4-- Have a dummy .f fortran file to "experiment" on with the script or use as a showcase what the script does. (Free formatting, type declaration, changing DO loops and if statements)
